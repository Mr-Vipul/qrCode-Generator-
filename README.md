Saves the QR code as an image file (e.g., PNG format).
Simple to use and lightweight.
Prerequisites

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
cd qr-code-generator

Usage
Open the qr_code_generator.py file and replace the link in the qrcode.make() method with the URL you want to create a QR code for:

python
Copy code
import qrcode

# Generate QR code
img = qrcode.make('https://www.your-link.com')  # Paste your link here

# Save the QR code as an image file
img.save("QRCode.png")
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python qr_code_generator.py
A QR code image will be generated and saved in the project directory as QRCode.png.
